On the options page you can configure your Cookie Wall.
<ul>
<li>Add a background image</li>
<li>Add a logo</li>
<li>Customise the text on the confirmation button</li>
<li>Add the appropriate text to explain the Cookie Wall (use the read-more if you have a lot of text to display)</li>
<li>Add your Google Analytics UA code to make sure your statistics donâ€™t suffer from the Cookie Wall.</li>
</ul>
After this basic configuration you are presented with a snippet that should either be put in your .htaccess file in case of an Apache server or Nginx-config in case of a Nginx server. This will immediately activate the wall.

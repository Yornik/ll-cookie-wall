# Cookie Wall for WordPress

## Configure the Cookie Wall
On the options page you can configure your Cookie Wall.

- Add a background image
- Add a logo
- Customise the text on the confirmation button
- Add the appropriate text to explain the Cookie Wall (use the read-more if you have a lot of text to display)
- Add your Google Analytics UA code to make sure your statistics donâ€™t suffer from the Cookie Wall.
- After this basic configuration you are presented with a snippet that should either be put in your .htaccess file in case of an Apache server or Nginx-config in case of a Nginx server. This will immediately activate the wall.
